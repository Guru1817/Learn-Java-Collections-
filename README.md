 Java Collections Examples

 A hands-on collection of Java programs demonstrating the core **Collections Framework**, with examples for `List`, `Map`, and `Set`.

 What’s Inside

- **List/** – Examples using `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, and demonstration of common operations like adding, removing, and iterating.
- **Map/** – Code snippets for `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and operations such as putting, retrieving, and iterating over entries.
- **Set/** – Demonstrations of `HashSet` and `TreeSet`, showcasing unique element storage, ordering, and basic operations.

Tech Stack
- Written in **Java (JDK 8+)**
- Built using core Java concepts and the Collections API.

Project Structure
```
Collection/
├── List/
│ └── ... (Java examples using List)
├── Map/
│ └── ... (Java examples using Map)
├── Set/
│ └── ... (Java examples using Set)
└── README.md
```

Each folder contains runnable Java files that cover:
- Common operations (add, remove, iterate, etc.)
- Example use cases and best practices

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Guru1817/Collection.git
   cd Collection
   ```
2.Navigate to any package folder—for example, Map:
```
cd Map
```
3.Compile:
```
javac *.java
```
4.Run:
```

Future Enhancements

-Add examples for Queue, Deque, and PriorityQueue                                                                
-Demonstrate Concurrent Collections like ConcurrentHashMap                                                 
-Include Java 8+ Stream API usage with Collections                                          
-Add unit tests using JUnit for each example                                                                
-Optional: Create a README.md inside each folder with detailed explanations
